CoHMM
=====

A Co-design proxy application for the Heterogeneous Multiscale Method
(HMM) augmented with adaptive sampling. This source code was used to
generate the data in the paper: B. Rouet-Leduc et al., *Spatial
adaptive sampling in multiscale simulation*,
Comput. Phys. Commun. **185** (2014) 1857-1864
([link](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2014.03.011)).

Original authors of the source code include Bertrand Rouet-Leduc and
the students of the 2013
[Los Alamos Co-Design Summer School](http://codesign.lanl.gov/summer-school). CoHMM
is now maintained by ExMatEx: Exascale Co-Design Center for Materials
in Extreme Environments ([exmatex.org](http://exmatex.org)).


Quick start
-----------

    make
    ./cohmm 1  # 'input/input1.txt' -- fast analytical model, 400 grid points
    ./cohmm 2  # 'input/input2.txt' -- fast analytical model, 10,000 grid points
    ./cohmm 3  # 'input/input3.txt' -- slow molecular dynamics, 100 grid points
    ./cohmm 4  # 'input/input4.txt' -- slow molecular dynamics, 400 grid points

These four inputs are representative of the runs in the Rouet-Leduc et
al. (2014) paper. With 400 grid points, full program execution
requires approximately 200,000 fine-scale calls. The wall-clock time
for full execution with the "fast analytical model" (input 1) is about
a second. The equivalent simulation with molecular dynamics response
(input 4) is far slower. Each molecular dynamics fine-scale call may
require about a minute on a single CPU thread, and task
parallelization over the ~200,000 calls becomes very important.

Task Parallelization
--------------------

At the top of the Makefile, set `DO_OPENMP=ON` to enable OpenMP
parallelization of the fine-scale flux calculation for each HMM
cell. The environment variable `OMP_NUM_THREADS` controls the number
of OpenMP threads.  There is a single OpenMP command `#pragma omp
parallel`, which appears in the function `cohmm.c::fluxes()`. We
welcome parallelization implementations for alternate coarse
task-based programming models and runtimes.


Description of subdirectories
-----------------------------

- `CoMDLib/` : CoMD molecular dynamics library modified to allow
  strained periodic boundaries. This version of CoMD also enables
  thread-safe concurrency. (Branched from
  [www.exmatex.org/comd.html](http://www.exmatex.org/comd.html).)
    
- `input/inputX.txt` : Input file `X`

- `output/simulationX/` : Corresponding output generated by CoHMM

- `supplement/` : Additional files that were used to generate the
  figures in the Rouet-Leduc et al. (2014) paper. In particular,
  `supplement/input/` contains the full set of inputs. For simplicity,
  however, this version of the code replaces spline interpolation with
  linear interpolation, which we find to be nearly as effective.
